                <article class="bio"> Meet Doug... who is often mistaken for Yee. After watching his parents run a very successful pizza business in Calgary, Matt Cleveland learned how to make people happy, one topping at a time. 
                    Opening the doors to Okotoks Pizza in 2004, Matt has managed to evolve the fresh, traditional Greek-style pizza his family perfected 
                    back in the mid 80s to a more modern and convenient comfort food for today’s family on the go. 
                    
                    Okotoks Pizzas are made with only the freshest ingredients 
                    like mozzarella, roma tomatoes, made-from-scratch sauce and even features premium toppings like Sorriso Pepperoni, salami from Valbella meats and a healthy Flax crust. You feel good about ordering it.
                    You feel good about eating it. And you feel even better knowing we're always ready to make you more.</article>
